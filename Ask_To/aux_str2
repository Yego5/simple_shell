:summary::
The provided C code contains five functions that are useful for string manipulation. The functions are `_strdup()`, `_strlen()`, `cmp_chars()`, `_strtok()`, and `_isdigit()`. `_strdup()` duplicates a string, `_strlen()` calculates the length of a string, `cmp_chars()` compares two strings for character equality, `_strtok()` splits a string into tokens using a delimiter, and `_isdigit()` checks if a string only contains digits. These functions can be used in various applications for string manipulation.

:Discuss::
This is a C code that provides a few functions that are commonly used in string manipulation. The functions are as follows:

1. `_strdup()` - This function duplicates a string in the heap memory. It takes a `const char *s` as input and returns a duplicated string.

2. `_strlen()` - This function calculates the length of a string. It takes a `const char *s` as input and returns the length of the string as an `int`.

3. `cmp_chars()` - This function compares the characters of two strings. It takes two inputs, `char str[]` and `const char *delim`, and returns 1 if all characters in the `str` string are equal to any character in the `delim` string. Otherwise, it returns 0.

4. `_strtok()` - This function splits a string by a delimiter. It takes two inputs, `char str[]` and `const char *delim`, and returns the next token of the string. It uses a static variable to keep track of the state of the string being split.

5. `_isdigit()` - This function checks if a string is a number. It takes a `const char *s` as input and returns 1 if the string contains only digits. Otherwise, it returns 0.
