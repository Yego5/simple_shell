:Summary::
The given code contains three functions related to memory allocation and reallocation in C programming language. The first function `_memcpy()` copies a block of memory from a source pointer to a destination pointer. The second function `_realloc()` reallocates memory for a previously allocated memory block, copying the contents to a new block and freeing the old block. The third function `_reallocdp()` is similar to `_realloc()` but specifically designed to reallocate memory blocks of double pointers. These functions can be useful for dynamically resizing data structures and managing memory allocation in C programs.

This code contains three functions related to memory allocation and reallocation.

The first function `_memcpy()` is a helper function that copies a block of memory from a source pointer to a destination pointer, given a size parameter. This is achieved by iterating over the memory block and copying each byte from the source pointer to the destination pointer.

The second function `_realloc()` is used to reallocate a memory block, given a pointer to the previously allocated memory block, its old size, and the new size. The function first checks if the given pointer is NULL, in which case it simply allocates new memory of the given size. If the new size is zero, it frees the previously allocated memory and returns NULL. If the new size is equal to the old size, it returns the given pointer as is. Otherwise, it allocates a new memory block of the new size, copies the contents of the old memory block to the new one using `_memcpy()` and frees the old memory block before returning the new pointer.

The third function `_reallocdp()` is similar to `_realloc()` but is specifically designed to reallocate memory blocks of double pointers. It takes a double pointer as input and reallocates memory for it similar to `_realloc()`. Additionally, it also iterates over the old memory block and copies each pointer to the new memory block.
