:Summary::
The given code contains three functions used to manage and access environment variables in a shell program. The `cmp_env_name()` function compares the names of environment variables. The `_getenv()` function retrieves the value of an environment variable by name, and `_env()` prints all environment variables and their values to the standard output. These functions are used to manage and access environment variables in a shell program.

:Discuss::
This code seems to be a part of a shell program, possibly a Unix shell, which allows users to interact with the operating system and execute commands. Let's go through the code line by line to understand its functionality.

```
#include "shell.h"
```
This line includes the header file `shell.h`, which presumably contains declarations of functions, variables and macros used in the program.

```
int cmp_env_name(const char *nenv, const char *name)
```
This function takes two parameters, `nenv` and `name`, both pointers to constant characters. It compares the characters of `nenv` and `name` until it reaches the equal sign (`=`) or until the characters are not equal. If the characters are not equal, it returns 0, indicating that the strings are not equal. If it reaches the equal sign, it returns the number of characters compared plus one, indicating the length of the name.

```
char *_getenv(const char *name, char **_environ)
```
This function takes two parameters, `name` and `_environ`. `name` is a pointer to a constant character and represents the name of an environment variable. `_environ` is a pointer to an array of pointers to characters and represents the environment variables. The function searches through the `_environ` array to find an environment variable with the same name as `name`. It calls the `cmp_env_name()` function to compare the names of each environment variable until it finds a match. If it finds a match, it returns a pointer to the value of the environment variable. If it doesn't find a match, it returns NULL.

```
int _env(data_shell *datash)
```
This function takes one parameter, `datash`, a pointer to a `data_shell` structure. This function prints the values of all environment variables to the standard output. It uses a loop to iterate through the `_environ` array and prints each variable followed by a newline character.
