:summary::
The `exit_shell` function is a part of a shell program and is responsible for exiting the shell. It takes a pointer to a `data_shell` struct as an argument. The function checks if the second argument passed to the shell program is a valid integer, and sets the exit status of the shell program based on the value of the second argument. If the second argument is not a valid integer or it has more than 10 digits or is larger than the maximum value of an integer, then the function prints an error message and sets the exit status to 2. The function returns 0 if it has executed successfully.

:Discussion::
The code is a function called `exit_shell` which is a part of a shell program and is responsible for exiting the shell. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The function takes a pointer to a `data_shell` struct as an argument.

2. The first thing the function does is to declare some variables: `ustatus`, `is_digit`, `str_len`, and `big_number`. 

3. The function checks if the second argument passed to the shell program (stored in `datash->args[1]`) is not `NULL`. If it is not `NULL`, then the function proceeds to check whether the second argument is a valid integer.

4. The function calls `_atoi` function to convert the second argument to an integer. If the second argument is not a valid integer, then `_atoi` returns 0. The function then checks if the second argument is a valid integer by calling `_isdigit` function. If the second argument is not a valid integer, or if it has more than 10 digits, or if it is larger than the maximum value of an integer, then the function prints an error message using the `get_error` function, sets `datash->status` to 2, and returns 1.

5. If the second argument is a valid integer, then the function calculates the exit status of the shell program by taking the modulus of the second argument with 256. The exit status is then stored in `datash->status`.

6. The function returns 0, indicating that it has executed successfully.
