:Summary::
This code is a C program that defines five functions that provide help information for various built-in commands in a shell. The functions provide brief descriptions and explanations of the env, setenv, unsetenv, and exit commands, as well as general help information for the shell. The functions use the write() system call to output the help information to standard output and the _strlen() function to determine the length of each help string.

:Explain?::
This is a C program containing a set of functions that provide help information for various built-in commands in a shell. The functions are defined as follows:

aux_help_env(): This function provides help information for the env command. It prints a brief description of the env command, followed by a short explanation of what the command does.

aux_help_setenv(): This function provides help information for the setenv command. It prints a brief description of the setenv command, followed by a short explanation of what the command does.

aux_help_unsetenv(): This function provides help information for the unsetenv command. It prints a brief description of the unsetenv command, followed by a short explanation of what the command does.

aux_help_general(): This function provides general help information for the shell. It prints the version of the shell, followed by a description of the available built-in commands.

aux_help_exit(): This function provides help information for the exit command. It prints a brief description of the exit command, followed by a short explanation of what the command does.

Each function uses the write() system call to output the help information to standard output. The _strlen() function is also used to determine the length of each help string.

Overall, this code provides a helpful set of functions that can be called by a shell to provide users with information about built-in commands and their usage.
